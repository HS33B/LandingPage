# LandingPage

Today I'll be creating a landing page for a website. I have completed all the FlexBox CSS-EXERCISES and now I am pretty confident that I can easily create the LandingPage. I will also be using several pictures and my own ideas to make it even better. Furthermore, I'll try to be as creative and productive as possible.
